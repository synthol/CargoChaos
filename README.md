Cargo Chaos is a very simple top-down cargo delivery game made in Python using Pygame. Cargo Chaos was made for Ludum Dare 53 and has been submitted under "The Jam" format. The theme for the jam was "Delivery". Cargo Chaos was my first Ludum Dare submission ever and also my first time using Python for game development, normally I'd use the Godot game engine or C++ with a graphical library. Excuse the spagetti code as I was learning multiple things during the jam which includes Python, Pygame, and Ludum Dare. You can view the Ludum Dare submission over at [Ludum Dare 53](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/cargo-chaos).
